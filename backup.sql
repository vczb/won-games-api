With Dorfromantik, you can immerse yourself in a quiet, peaceful world at any time and take a break from everyday life. At the same time, Dorfromantik offers a challenge for those who are looking for one: To beat the highscore, you need to carefully plan and strategically place your tiles.\n<br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/dorfromantik/banner_gameplay_english2.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></p><br>\nIn Dorfromantik you start with a stack of procedurally generated tiles. One after the other, you draw the top tile of the stack, place it on one available slot and rotate for the best fit. Thereby groups and combinations of landscapes are formed, such as forests, villages or water bodies, and you are rewarded with points depending on how well the tile fits.\n<br><br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/dorfromantik/mp4/Gameplay.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br><br>\nOn some tiles you will also encounter special objects that give you a quest: For example, the windmill wants to border 6 grain fields, the locomotive wants to be connected to 10 tracks or the deer wants to inhabit a forest with at least 50 trees. Fulfill these quests to get more tiles to continue the expansion of your landscape.&nbsp;The game ends when the tile stack is used up.\n<br><br>\nAs you expand the landscape, you can advance into new, colorful biomes and discover pre-placed game objects that give you long-term tasks.

Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!\n<br><br><b>Features </b><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm!  </b> Raise animals, grow crops, start an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You'll have plenty of space to create the farm of your dreams. \n<br><br></li><li><b>4 Player Farming!</b> Invite 1-3 players to join you in the valley online! Players can work together to build a thriving farm, share resources, and improve the local community.  As more hands are better than one, players have the option to scale profit margin on produce sold for a more challenging experience.\n<br><br></li><li><b>Improve your skills over time. </b> As you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you'll learn new cooking and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by choosing from a variety of professions. \n<br><br></li><li><b>Become part of the local community. </b> With over 30 unique characters living in Stardew Valley, you won't have a problem finding new friends! Each person has their own daily schedule, birthday, unique mini-cutscenes, and new things to say throughout the week and year. As you make friends with them, they will open up to you, ask you for help with their personal troubles, or tell you their secrets! Take part in seasonal festivals such as the luau, haunted maze, and feast of the winter star. \n<br><br></li><li><b>Explore a vast, mysterious cave. </b> As you travel deeper underground, you'll encounter new and dangerous monsters, powerful weapons, new environments, valuable gemstones, raw materials for crafting and upgrading tools, and mysteries to be uncovered. \n<br><br></li><li><b>Breathe new life into the valley.</b> Since JojaMart opened, the old way of life in Stardew Valley has changed. Much of the town's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair. Help restore Stardew Valley to it's former glory by repairing the old community center, or take the alternate route and join forces with Joja Corporation.\n<br><br></li><li><b>Court and marry a partner to share your life on the farm with. </b> There are 12 available bachelors and bachelorettes to woo, each with unique character progression cutscenes. Once married, your partner will live on the farm with you. Who knows, maybe you'll have kids and start a family?\n<br><br></li><li><b>Spend a relaxing afternoon at one of the local fishing spots. </b> The waters are teeming with seasonal varieties of delicious fish. Craft bait, bobbers, and crab pots to help you in your journey toward catching every fish and becoming a local legend! \n<br><br></li><li><b>Donate artifacts and minerals to the local museum. </b><br><br></li><li><b>Cook delicious meals and craft useful items to help you out.  </b>With over 100 cooking and crafting recipes, you'll have a wide variety of items to create. Some dishes you cook will even give you temporary boosts to skills, running speed, or combat prowess. Craft useful objects like scarecrows, oil makers, furnaces, or even the rare and expensive crystalarium. \n<br><br></li><li><b>Customize the appearance of your character and house. </b> With hundreds of decorative items to choose from, you'll have no trouble creating the home of your dreams!\n<br><br></li><li><b>Xbox controller support (with rumble)!

As a medium you see, hear and experience more than others, and with every new perspective you will change your perception on what happened at the Niwa resort.\n<br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_medium/3.gif" alt="" width="100%"></p><br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_medium/704.png" alt="" width="100%"></p>\n\n\nNever-seen-before and officially patented gameplay that plays out across two worlds displayed at the same time. Explore the physical world and the spirit world simultaneously, and use the interactions between them to solve dual-reality puzzles, unlock new paths, and awaken memories of past events.\n<br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_medium/4.gif" alt="" width="100%"></p><br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_medium/705.png" alt="" width="100%"></p>\n\n\n\nThe Medium’s spirit world is a dark mirror reflection of our reality, a grim and unsettling place where our unpunished deeds, evil urges, and vile secrets manifest themselves and can take on a form. This world has been invented and designed under the inspiration of Zdzisław Beksiński’s paintings, Polish dystopian surrealist internationally recognized for his distinctive and strikingly ominous style.\n<br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_medium/5.gif" alt="" width="100%"></p><br><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_medium/706.png" alt="" width="100%"></p>\n\n\nImmerse yourself in the disturbing and oppressive atmosphere of the game thanks to the original ‘dual’ soundtrack co-created by Akira Yamaoka and Arkadiusz Reikowski. Yamaoka-san is a legendary Japanese composer best known for his work on the Silent Hill series; Reikowski is a Hollywood Music in Media Awards nominee who worked on such acclaimed horror games as Blair Witch, Layers of Fear, and Observer. Now they join their creative forces for the music and songs of The Medium.\n<br><br><hr><p class="description__copyrights">\n            “The Medium” and all logos, characters, names, and related indicia are ®, TM &amp; © 2021 Bloober Team S.A.

Remaining unseen, they have been ruling mankind for hundreds of years. Your role will be not to just lead any particular country or region, but the Brotherhood: a centuries-old organization that works in the shadows and manipulates the entire world. Pull the strings of fate as you influence the present and future on a global scale, reconstructing the whole world to your liking.<br><br>\nStrategically manage your agents running errands in different countries and infiltrating government institutions to strip countries of their resources and seize control over decision-makers. Your choices will change the internal and foreign policies of countries.<br><br>\nA desire for power and wealth is not the only thing that drives the Brotherhood. It strives for a complete rebuilding of the world.<br><br>\nBeginning in the 17th century, you start making your own history, where in each mission of the game you will interfere in the main conflict of a certain period.<br><br>\nIn the Early Access version, you will take part in the Glorious Revolution in England. There you will face a hostile secret organization. Its methods are similar to yours, but the goals are completely different, and you have to figure them out.<br><br>\nYou need to act slowly and carefully not to raise the awareness of your clout in the country. You will otherwise be exposed and lose the level of influence already gained in this very country.<br><br>\nThere will be plenty of diplomatic, economic and military actions at your disposal. Pay close attention to the domestic politics of each country. If the ruling party’s ideology is very different from the views of various classes and estates, if tax levels are too high and public order too low, then expect a revolution. Or maybe this is what you seek?<br><br>\nYou cannot impose your will on the rulers - your manipulations in the game are indirect. You do not have the power to order a monarch to declare war on a neighboring country, but you can plant your agents in the right places, provoke deterioration in relations by indirect actions, arrange a border incident and bring the countries to a military conflict.<br><br>\nWe hope that you will spend many enjoyable hours exploring how the world works with Secret Government! Join the Brotherhood!\n<h4>List of Key Features</h4><ul><li><b>Rewrite History</b> - From the 17th century to the present day, the War of Independence to the French and Napoleonic Wars, each mission will drop players into major global conflicts, tasking them with manipulating the outcome to serve the Brotherhood’s ambitions.</li><li><b>Play Your Pawns</b> - The world’s most powerful figures - from national rulers to military superpowers - are but mere pawns to you. Learn to manipulate their complex AI machinations as you leverage their unique abilities to shape the world to your needs.</li><li><b>Indirect Influence</b> - Why should you have to do the heavy lifting of executing your diplomatic, economic, and militaristic ambitions? Plant your own agents and indirectly coerce others to do your bidding with over 50 types of actions intended to upend the world’s balance in your favor while keeping your hands clean.</li><li><b>Manipulate a Living World </b> - From ideologies to social classes, taxes to civil unrest, the world of Secret Government is comprised of countless interconnected sociopolitical systems that effectively simulate a believable and reactionary world. While world leaders strive to maintain the status quo, how will you destabilize the system and trigger worldwide change?</li><li><b>You’re Not Alone in the Shadows</b> - Facing down a hostile secret organization that isn’t afraid to manipulate their way into the history books, make every action and choice count in order to outthink the competition and maintain your hard-earned secrecy and level of infiltration in the shadows.</li></ul><br><p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://items.gog.com/secret_government/SGroadmap.png" alt="" width="100%"></p><i>*Please note that the roadmap may change as the game is in active development</i><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2020 1C Entertainment.

Although the positive impact of this revolution is obvious, every coin has a flipside; for every beneficial device developed with these new materials, so too were advanced weapons and other implements of war. Thus, the land became mired with turmoil, and remains in such a state even now.\n<br><br>\nEnter, the bracers: an organization established to serve as police and intermediaries alike, holding above all else the peace and safety of the lands under their jurisdiction. Whenever a citizen is in need of assistance, he or she may place a request at the local Bracer Guild -- and be it monster extermination, crime prevention or even peace talks among warring nations, the bracers will do whatever they can to resolve the matter cleanly and efficiently.\n<br><br>\nSome matters require a gentler touch than others, however. When an orbalship transporting a legendary "S-rank" bracer named Cassius Bright suddenly goes missing, said bracer's daughter, Estelle, and adoptive son, Joshua, must join forces in search of him across the entire Kingdom of Liberl.\n<br><br>\nAnd what they find along the way could change both of their lives forever...\n<br><br>\nHailed as one of the largest, longest and most meticulously detailed turn-based JRPG series of all time, this first chapter in the ongoing <i>Trails</i> saga sets the stage for what's quickly become Ys developer Nihon Falcom's most popular and best-selling franchise in their entire 30+ year history. Introducing people, places, ideas, events and lore that rival in complexity those of even the most highly-regarded fantasy epics in literature, the care and attention given to each and every NPC, location and historical in-game event is what sets <i>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</i> apart from its contemporaries.\n<br><br>\nCome join Estelle, Joshua, Scherazard, Olivier and the rest of the cast as they uncover the secret underbelly of Liberl in their first 50+ hour masterpiece, and see what Japanese gamers have been raving about for over ten years.\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Classic JRPG with over 50 hours of gameplay, strategic turn-based combat, and countless side-quests.</li><li class="description__features-point">A vast world where every NPC has a name and personality, every town has its own unique politics and economic concerns, and no detail is ever trivial.</li><li class="description__features-point">Widescreen and USB gamepad support, selectable difficulty and new game+ features.</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            ©2004-2014 Nihon Falcom Corporation.

It adds a brand new environment for you to explore and master – freshwater!Your new inhabitants	<img src="https://items.gog.com/megaquarium_freshwater_frenzy_-_deluxe_expansion/ff_store_page_header.png"><br><i><b>Freshwater Frenzy</b></i> is the first Deluxe Expansion for <i><b><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/megaquarium">Megaquarium</a></b></i>. It adds a brand new environment for you to explore and master – freshwater!<h4>Your new inhabitants</h4>From the prehistoric Arapaima to the infamous Piranha, <i><b>Freshwater Frenzy</b></i> is packed full of new species to discover. There are new care requirements to learn and demanding new aquascaping requirements to fulfil. From floating cover to bogwood, providing everything your inhabitants need will challenge even the seasoned curator!\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/megaquarium_freshwater_frenzy_-_deluxe_expansion/ff_angels.jpg"><h4>Become a breeder</h4>For the first time in <i><b><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/megaquarium">Megaquarium</a></b></i> history you will be able to rear baby animals in your aquarium. But make no mistake, fulfilling the unique breeding requirements of each animal is no easy task. Then there’s raising the young themselves, a job fraught with difficulties and requiring your constant attention.<h4>Ready, get set, hybridize!</h4>Some species can even be hybridized. By selective breeding you can create color and pattern combinations that reflect your style.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/megaquarium_freshwater_frenzy_-_deluxe_expansion/ff_hybrids.png"><h4>Introducing pH</h4>If that wasn’t enough, some animals will require you to maintain a specific pH in the tank. Will you satisfy this with clever use of passive sources? Or will you let the machines do the heavy lifting? The choice is yours.<h4>Accessories and posters</h4>Accessories are a brand new tool in your arsenal to optimize your aquarium. Equip them on your staff for powerful bonuses, but choose carefully, only one accessory may be equipped at a time.\n<br><br>\nDisseminate facts and fun by placing informative posters around your aquarium. Their value relies on the contents of the connected tank so design your exhibits wisely.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/megaquarium_freshwater_frenzy_-_deluxe_expansion/ff_poster_accessory.jpg"><h4>Reptiles and new tanks</h4>Reptiles such as turtles and crocs require land as well as water. Thankfully there are new tank designs which fulfil this need.\n<br><br>\nMeanwhile, tanks with suspended platforms can be used to bridge different areas of your aquarium together, while exciting your guests with a thrilling new perspective!<h4>Freshwater masterclass</h4>Explore everything that freshwater has to offer by completing the <i><b>Freshwater Frenzy</b></i> campaign. Each mission will challenge you to make the most of the new additions and explore the game in new ways.<h4>Features</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li>5 levels in a freshwater-focused campaign\n<br></li><li>30 freshwater species\n<br></li><li>7 new tanks\n<br></li><li>4 accessories to equip your staff\n<br></li><li>Dozens of new objects including decorations, plants, equipment and posters \n<br></li><li>4 brand new paints to keep your aquarium looking “fresh”</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            Copyright © 2020 Twice Circled Ltd.

Howeve	\n    \n    \n    \n            You awaken in a decrepit old mansion.<br><br>\nA woman with eyes of jade stands before You, informing You that You are the Master of the house, and she Your Maid. However, You have no memories, no concept of self—or, indeed, any certainty that You are even alive.<br><br>\nThe Maid invites You to join her on a journey through the mansion's lifeless halls, to behold the numerous tragedies that have befallen its residents. She suggests that among them, perhaps You will find some trace of Yourself.<br><br>\nBeyond the first door lies the year 1603.<br>\nIt is an era of unparalleled beauty, where art and theatre flourish. Roses bloom abundantly in the garden where the inseparable Rhodes siblings play, and though they appear to be free of worry and strife... not everyone is content to see them happy.<br><br>\nBeyond the second door lies the year 1707.<br>\nIn this era, the mansion lies in ruins, and a beast dwells within. He claims to yearn for a life of serenity, but it is not long before he yields to his innate savagery and a massacre ensues.<br><br>\nBeyond the third door lies the year 1869.<br>\nIn this technologically advanced era, people are always on the move. The mansion's master is an ambitious businessman who has invested in the rail industry. However, his obsession with wealth and power leads him to neglect and mistreat his wife.<br><br>\nBeyond the fourth door lies the year 1099.<br>\nThe Maid tells You that this is the final tale.

Both empires, however, were severely weakened. Six years later, in 634, the newly Islamized Arabs erupted forth from Arabia, quickly defeating the Byzantines and Persians. By 750, under the Umayyad Caliphate, the Muslim Arab Empire stretched from Spain to the borders of India.<br><br>\nThe Byzantine Empire, after losing its Levantine and North African provinces, survived the initial Islamic advance. Constantinople endured a year long siege (717-718), and this proved to be the beginning of the end for the Umayyad Caliphate. Eventually, weakened by defeats on the frontiers of their vast empire and internal unrest, the Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasid dynasty. The great Islamic Empire was now split into many separate, and often competing states. The Byzantines grew stronger under the Macedonian Dynasty (867-1056), and ended the period more powerful than they had been for many centuries.<br><br>\nIn Northern Europe, Viking raids started in the late 8th century. Superb sailors, they used their longboats to strike across the Baltic and North Seas against towns, farms and monasteries, and raid as far as Seville and Constantinople. Eventually they settled down, and created important states in Normandy and the Kievan Rus. Their invasions of the British Isles resulted in centuries of intermittent warfare with the English, Irish and Scottish kingdoms.<br><br>\nCharlemagne ruled as King of the Franks from 768-814 AD. The kingdom he inherited already included most of modern France and parts of Germany. By his death in 814, his empire encompassed modern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, northern Italy and a strip of northern Spain. In 800 he was crowned “Emperor of the Romans” by Pope Leo III. After his death the Carolingian Empire split into two main states, West Francia (modern France) and East Francia (modern Germany).<br><br>\nIn the 9th century the nomadic Magyars erupted into European history. Their western raids reached as far as Spain. Their defeat by the Germans at Lechfeld in 955 ended their threat to Western Europe and in 1000 their High Prince accepted Christianity and was recognised as King of Hungary by Pope Sylvester II, ruling under his Christian name of István (Stephen) I.\n<h4><br>\nSummary of features:</h4><ul><li>19 new factions</li><li>55 new units</li><li>76 new army lists</li><li>6 new Epic Battles</li><li>74 new Quick Battles</li><li>Expanded Custom Battles module.</li><li>Expanded Sandbox Campaign module.</li><li>6 new historically-based campaigns.</li><li>New Allies feature added in accompanying game update.</li></ul><h4>Details:</h4><ul><li>19 new named factions: Andalusians, Bulgars, Croatians, Dailami, Fatimids, French, Ghaznavids, Khazars, Khorasanians, Magyars, Moravians, Navarrese, Normans, Pechenegs, Polish, Rus, Scots, Serbians, Vikings.</li><li>55 new units: Huscarls (Spear), Huscarls (Axe), Mounted Huscarls, Berserkers, Well-Equipped Shieldwall (Offensive), Shieldwall (Offensive), Hirdsmen, Dismounted Hirdsmen, Picked Irish Foot (Axe), Irish Foot (Axe), Irish Kerns, (Dark Age) Armoured Lancers, Dismounted Armoured Lancers, (Dark Age) Lancers, Dismounted Lancers, (Dark Age) Armoured Cavalry (Light Spear), Dismounted Armoured Cavalry, (Dark Age) Cavalry (Light Spear), Dismounted Cavalry, Crossbowmen, Light Crossbowmen, Byzantine Kataphraktoi, Tagmatic Lancers &amp;

Hack’n’slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the family of Bergsons, with all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption.\n\n<h4><b>FEATURES:</b></h4><b>GAMEPLAY</b><br>\nGameplay-wise it's a unique mix of action-adventure RPG, rogue-lite and hack and slash game. By leveling up, you develop not only individual characters but also the entire family. There is no permadeath and you can change family members between the dungeon runs.\n<br><br><b>STORY</b><br>\nThe story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness.\n<br><br><b>DUNGEON CRAWLING</b><br>\nAll the dungeons in the game are procedurally generated, which means their layout is different with each adventure. There can be from two to four levels of each dungeon, with a unique boss fight at the end. You can always get back to the previous dungeons to get extra XP or finish all the side quests.\n<br><br><b>CHARACTERS &amp; SKILLS</b><br>\nRanged attacks, magic spells, blocks, stuns, healing, evasions and passive skills - it's all there for you to discover, unlock and upgrade. You can choose from seven different family members, each one having unique skill sets. The father, John - a protective warrior with a sword and shield. The elder daughter Linda - a precise archer. Kevin, a quiet fighter equipped with deadly daggers. Lucy - a lively and bold fire mage. Mark - a mindful martial arts fighter. Joey - who smashes his enemies with a sledgehammer. And the latest addition to the family - Apan, a mighty healer and a firm defender in one.\n<br><br><b>ART STYLE</b><br>\nA combination of hand painted pixel art and frame-by-frame animations partnered with modern lighting techniques come to life to create the beautifully dangerous world of Children of Morta!\n\n<br><br><b>CO-OP</b><br>\nLOCAL CO-OP is already available in the game, so two players can become the Bergsons and fight the Corruption together. ONLINE CO-OP is still in development and will be released in a future update.\n\n<br><br><b>FAMILY TRIALS</b><br>\nA mode separate from the Main Story campaign, offering new systems, items, objectives, character builds, and more - all set in a series of completely randomized dungeons.\n\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2017 11 bit studios S.A. and Dead Mage Inc.

Honor brings Imperial titles like acolyte, knight, and baron. Build grand throne rooms for your noble as they rise through the royal ranks. Dress them in finery fit for a monarch, or the prestige armor of a great warrior. They'll make speeches from the throne, inspiring your people, and play piano, harp, and harpsichord.\n<br><br>\nEach title allows you to choose or upgrade an Imperial permit:\n<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Imperial troopers, janissaries, and cataphracts</b> drop in to fight for you in times of need. \n<br></li><li><b>Orbital strikes and orbital salvoes</b> blast your foes from above.\n<br></li><li><b>Shuttles</b> take you where you want to go.\n<br></li><li><b>Labor teams</b> help when you are shorthanded.</li></ul><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/rimworld/2-psychics.jpg"><br>\nThere are multiple ways to develop psychic powers.

Since RimWorld is a story-generation game, quests aren't fixed like in other games. Instead, the system procedurally generates unique quests with every new game. Different goals, foes, guests, rewards, helpers, special threats, and world conditions combine to create endless varied stories and challenges. Quest givers may even provide special helpers during the quest - for example, a quest may ask you to fight a huge mechanoid cluster, but also include help from elite Imperial cataphracts to make the battle winnable.\n<br><br>\nQuests will reward you with Imperial titles, new allies, unique implants, archotechnological artifacts, gear, faction goodwill, and more.\n<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>Imperial hospitality</b> quests ask the player to host a group of Imperials. The guests may be injured or healthy, useful allies or helpless burdens, single or numerous. They may be hunted by mercenaries, pirates, mechanoids, or more. You might need to get the guests to an escape shuttle under fire.\n<br></li><li><b>Refugee hospitality</b> quests present a group of impoverished travelers asking for help. There are many outcomes. They may reward you later for your help, or betray you in the middle of the night. A third party may make you an offer to betray them. If you treat them well, they may spontaneously offer to join you. Since they have no faction, you can treat them with kindness or brutality.\n<br></li><li><b>Animal hospitality</b> quests see you caring for a group of animals struck with sickness or hunted by enemies.\n<br></li><li><b>Prisoner hospitality</b> quests ask you to keep prisoners under guard.\n<br></li><li><b>Shuttle crash</b> quests begin with a shuttle crashlanded near your colony, under attack by enemies. Quickly assemble a defense around the shuttle and help its defenders drive off the attackers while keeping the civilians safe, until the rescue shuttle extracts them.\n<br></li><li><b>Monument</b> quests ask the player to build a grand monument, and sometimes, to protect it from attacks.\n<br></li><li><b>Aerial assault</b> quests have you supply troops for an ally's airborne assault against a rival faction.

Host the Imperial High Stellarch and his elite Stellic Guards in your luxurious court, protect them from their enemies, and be invited to leave the rimworld as an honored Imperial guest.\n<br><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/rimworld/4-mechclusters.jpg"><br>\nMechanoids can now create <i>mechanoid clusters</i> - groups of new mechanoid buildings which work together to present a unique tactical challenge.\n<br><br>\nMech clusters always appear in an initially dormant state. The player can take the time to decide and execute a plan of attack. This puts the player on the offensive, which contrasts with the defense-oriented fights in the base game. Mech cluster elements include:\n<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><b>World condition makers</b> that poison the air, darken the sky, or create some other world condition.\n<br></li><li><b>Shields</b> to block bullets or mortar fire\n<br></li><li><b>Factories</b> to assemble new mechanoids over time.\n<br></li><li><b>Beacons</b> to call reinforcements.\n<br></li><li><b>Turrets, mortars, and surrounding walls</b>.\n<br></li><li><b>Unstable power units</b> which you can attack to create explosions, or steal.\n<br></li><li><b>Alarm systems</b> of various types.\n<br></li><li><b>Mechanoid defenders</b> including the new Pikeman sniper mech.\n<br></li><li><b>Gloomlight</b> units provide an extra reward if you eliminate the cluster with precision.</li></ul><br>\nEach mech cluster generates with a unique layout, presenting a unique tactical puzzle. Some of them will require a frontal assault. Others may be susceptible to mortar bombardment. You may be able to plant explosives inside the cluster before waking it up. A few can be defeated with a key sniper shot to a critical structure. There are many other tactics. Mech clusters can even be used to your advantage if you can lure foes or undesired allies into them.\n<br><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/rimworld/5-imperialtech.jpg"><br><br>\nThis expansion adds a ton of new gear.

The no-nonsense, assertive Risa, and the antisocial Miya couldn't be more incompatible, with their arguments frequently bordering on shouting matches. At the time, the whole school was in high spirits in anticipation of Christmas. Amidst the flirtations of couples, established and spontaneous ones alike, excitement was brewing over the informal student poll to decide "St. Michael's Best Couples." Not having a girlfriend, Risa didn't think the matter concerned her... Until she and Miya were chosen as a pair! \n <br><br>\nNaturally, Risa denied having any sort of romantic relationship, but the classmates who endorsed them simply smiled gently with the reasoning of refined girls brought up in respectable families, saying, "You always appear to be having such fun." Although the two agree to go along with it for appearance's sake, it turns out they'll also be stuck on an committee with four other couples, planning events for the upcoming holidays of Christmas and Valentine's Day.\n<br><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/a_kiss_for_the_petals_maidens_of_michael/3_Couples.png"><br><b>What's more... those four other couples are:</b><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/a_kiss_for_the_petals_maidens_of_michael/4_YuunaNanami.png"><br>\nMatsubara Yuuna, chairman of the Campus Improvement Committee, which effectively serves as the student council, and her junior, Oda Nanami.\n <br><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/a_kiss_for_the_petals_maidens_of_michael/5_SaraKaede.png">\nThe popular student model, Kitajima Sara, and her cousin, Kitajima Kaede.\n<br><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/a_kiss_for_the_petals_maidens_of_michael/6_ReoMai.png"><br>\nThe singing sensation of the school's culture festival, Kawamura Reo, and her girlfriend, Sawaguchi Mai.\n <br><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/a_kiss_for_the_petals_maidens_of_michael/7_ErisShizuku.png"><br>\nAnd finally, the transfer student with her own "Lily Platinum" fan club, Shitogi Eris, and the school's highly regarded foremost scribe, Kirishima Shizuku...\n <br><br><br>\nNothing but the most prominent couples on campus.\n <br><br>\nWill they be able to make it through the upcoming events in the company of these prominent couples?

One such hero is a farmer in the small village of West Harbor. Raised by the elven ranger, Daeghun, as his own child, our hero will embark on a grandiose quest against the King of Shadows. Neverwinter Nights 2 is the tale of his deeds. His adventures continue in Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer. Our protagonist discovers that an ominous spell has fallen on him. A curse of perpetual hunger--one which can only be quelled by consuming the souls of spirits. In order to remove the curse, he has to travel to the Shadow Realm, which harbors dark secrets and tormented souls.\n<br><br>\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir gives as a breather from grand quests of destiny and epic ordeals. You simply assemble a group of four adventurers (either by carefully picking out each of their statistics and skills or by randomly re-rolling your characters until you find the ones that suit you) and go where the wind takes you. Just make sure to get a good look at the map as you will need it to explore the wide open region of Samarach and the Sword Coast.

Dungeon Siege plunges you into a continuous 3D fantasy world where you face off against an army of evil that has been unleashed.\n<br><br>\nYou begin as a humble farmer, and as you travel through the world and gain new skills, you can gather a party of up to eight characters to aid you. Dungeon Siege impels the player into one over-the-top battle after the other as the storyline unfolds and a larger plot begins to reveal itself.\n<br><br>\nA world of adventure where you can explore sprawling landscapes in a seamlessly unfolding story awaits...\n<br><br><hr><h4>Dungeon Siege II</h4><br>\nIt’s been a generation since you vanquished the evil that plagued the Land of Ehb, and now…a new menace has awakened. In <b>Dungeon Siege II</b>, the sequel to the best-selling RPG from Gas Powered Games, you will be called on to again wield sword and spell to save the world from a growing abomination many years in the making.\n<br><br>\nA thousand years ago, the crusaders of Azunai crossed swords with the legions of Zaramoth in the final battle of a century-long rebellion. As the tyrannical god Zaramoth struck the final blow through Azunai’s trembling shield, the earth shook. In that moment, the forces of magic were unchained, and both armies were consumed in a brilliant cataclysm that stretched for leagues across the Plain of Tears. Only a scarred wasteland remained as final testament to the First Age of Man.\n<br><br>\nAnd for a millennium, magic has continued to spread to the farthest corners of the world, freely flowing to any who would command it. But the tide of magic has begun to wane, heeding instead the call of an ancient legacy. From the Plain of Tears a new heir beckons, and with each day his strength grows. Consuming those who submit, eradicating those who resist. With none to oppose his ascendance, the circle will be complete, and an ancient age will begin anew.\n<br><br>\nWhat fate will befall the Second Age of Man? The time for judgment is nigh.\n<br><br><hr><h4>Dungeon Siege III</h4><br>\nFor centuries legionnaires have protected the nation of Ehb until they were betrayed and all but driven to the brink of extinction. Now that evil has returned to Ehb the people turn to the few remaining Legionnaires for the protection of the past. As an heir to the legion will you accept this plea for help? How it will all be resolved is up to you!\n<br><br><b>Dungeon Siege III</b> is an Action RPG that seamlessly blends intuitive fast-paced gameplay, a robust RPG system featuring a large selection of abilities, loot galore and the depth of story Square-Enix and Obsidian Entertainment are known for creating. \n<br><br><i>Dungeon Siege III also supports Polish and Russian language (text).</i><br><br><hr><h4>Dungeon Siege III: Treasures of the Sun</h4><br>\nIn <b>Dungeon Siege III: Treasures of the Sun</b>, players will extend their journey and travel beyond the borders of Ehb to an all-new environment: the Aranoi Desert.

The mechanics are complex and true to life, where small events can spiral into the collapse of kingdoms. Easy to learn, but impossible to master. It's set in a low-fantasy world with graphics aimed at stimulating your imagination.</b><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/featuresstore.png"><h4>Living World</h4>Full of different races, cultures, old and new gods and strange creatures. Night turns to day, climate and weather change, and migrations of animals and people flow. Droughts and pestilence, pirates and bandits, and new discoveries will ensure kingdoms and empires come and go with or without your intervention. No game will ever be the same, as all content, background stories, and easter-eggs are generated uniquely each iteration, while still sticking to a rich background story that you will unfold piece by piece.<h4>Base Building on a Huge Scale</h4>Take your settlement further that you ever have by winning the hearts of your subjects or by whipping them into submission. Have their number swell your insignificant colony into a metropolis of tens of thousands. Be careful not to overreach, as everything you build requires upkeep and a slight disruption of your production, or a dip in your standing, could quickly spiral out of control and your people will not hesitate to depose a thoughtless king.<h4>Grand Strategy</h4>As your capital grows, it must be sustained by the villages, towns, lumber camps, castles and ports that constitute your kingdom. But you're not alone in. Other kingdoms and despots are eager to forge an alliance or expand their borders, so tend to your relations and try not to stand out culturally. To grow your might, you must engage in global trade, where there are no fixed prices, no currency to mint, but based on supply and demand, turning you rich one day, and your goods worthless on the next, if you're not paying attention.<h4>Massive Tactical Battles</h4>Gather forces from allies and vassals and conscript traveling mercenaries and heroes to bolster your ranks with up to 20k individual units. Use tactics and skill to encircle your enemy, or let your reputation demoralize them before clashes of up to 40k units, which outcomes dictate the rise and fall of empires.<h4>Nobility &amp; Slaves</h4>Break the backs of slaves as they make your beds and swab your floors. Just throw them a bone from time to time to keep them from rising up in revolt. Appoint nobles, or import them from other kingdoms and have them manage different aspects of your kingdom to boosts your production and standing, but be careful with whom to trust, and reward them accordingly as some might get the idea to usurp you or join your enemies.<h4>Matching Soundtrack</h4>Thanks to the fulfilment of our first Kickstarter stretchgoal the game will have a fully fledged soundtrack made by <b>@jasinkamusic</b>. We already have some tracks done which neatly fit into the playable prototype.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/store01.png"><br>\nExplore the lives and personalities of your subjects as you build the basic necessities to survive your first winter. Hunt and forage and farm to keep them fed and weave clothes to keep them warm.\n<br>\nThe people that makes up your settlement come in many different races, with their own skills and flaws. Each one is an individual, with its own personality, agenda, preferences, friends and traits.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/store05.jpg"><br>\nYou don't control them directly, you rather make the plans and they execute intelligently. If you take good care of them, more will immigrate to your settlement. If you wrong them, they might serve you inefficiently, or openly rebel against you.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/store02.png"><br>\nTake your settlement further that you ever have before by winning the hearts of your subjects or by whipping them into submission. Build cities with up to <b>30k individuals</b>.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/procrop.gif"><br><br>\nAs your numbers swell, you will stop focusing on the individuals and turn your attention towards groups. A group can be described as a combination of race, social standing, religion and trade.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/scale.gif"><br><br>\nAnd in Songs of Syx, subjects don't like those who are different from them. It is up to you if you want to encourage such behavior by discriminating some groups and imposing privileges on another, or if you want to create a diverse and tolerant society, utilizing the different traits of races.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/store03.png"><br>\nCall your banners and swell your ranks with mercenaries and boost the morale of your soldiers with a hero or two. Enjoy <b>massive battles</b>, that aim to be realistic with low kill rate and fragile morale, as you fend off an invader, or reclaim a kingdom that is rightfully yours.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/fighting.gif"><br><br>\nYour city might get raided by bandits. Raiders wants your goods, and if you don't surrender them they will attack. As you grow, battles will mostly take place outside of cities and out on the field.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/clash.gif"><br><br>\nAnd the battle matters. It will take years to build up a force and if you're defeated, the enemy will hunt down those fleeing and annihilate your army, while suffering minor casualties themselves. You will then have to sue for a costly peace, unless you have enough manpower and funds to quickly raise another.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/store04.png"><br>\nSyx is a living world, full of different races, cultures, old and new gods and strange creatures.

Harmony and peace ensued for many a centuries, as vast road networks and outposts connected the thriving cities. But one unfortunate day, a faction of greedy Men stumbled upon the prison of the God of Chaos and freed him on the promise of immortality. As the gods fought, the cities were erased and priceless artifacts and tomes of knowledge were lost. Outnumbered and desperate, the chaos lord unleashed a plague on the world, turning the dead into soldiers to refill his ranks, and used magical weapons of fire that layed waste to the remaining kingdoms and fortresses. Finally, all the avatars of the gods of order had been slain and thus banished from the physical realm. Failing to deliver his promise of immortality the god of chaos was assassinated by his fickle followers, and as he fell came with him ice and snow that covered the whole of Syx for an age.\n<br>\nBut, good news! The ice has now receded and the world is in dire need of your leadership.\n<br>\nPlay as the Dondorians, masterful miners with a will cut in stone. They spend their lives digging for Dyhrlium, fighting their arch enemies - the Amevias - and dreaming of rebuilding their legendary capital at Mt. Cerebus. They are mysteriously born fully grown, capable miners, and live long lives, preferably deep inside the mountains.\n<br>\nOr play as Men, fragile and mortal, but equipped with free will and an ingenuity that has the potential to far surpass their Dondorian cousins. Unite their shattered and warring kingdoms under one banner, but beware of temptation that may lead you astray. And do hurry up, as there are whispers of the dark lord of chaos' return!\n<br>\nAfter the war of the gods, the few Kantors that remained withdrew from the world to spend their remaining millennia in the frozen north. They are filled with wrath and disgust for men and their treasonous nature and generally stay clear of civilization, but if you're lucky you might be able to attract a few to your city, where they will be of tremendous worth.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/scale2.gif"><br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/reviewstore.png"><br><b>Here is some feedback from our prototype players;</b><br><i>"So I've been playing it for about 2 hours and holy crap...

Currently, the base game contains <b>60-70% of the features</b>, but these haven't been fleshed out and everything is unpolished. The game has been a prototype for 6 years and will be in EA for a long, long time, although the aim is that it will still be fun to play during these years. You are more than welcome to tag along for the ride, but only if you like what's already been created, feel enthusiastic about the vision and have money to spare in these difficult times.\n<br>\nUntil now, focus has been on adding and fleshing out the basic ingredients that makes a city builder. \n<br>\nUltimately, <b>This game is a long term thing</b>. In the near future we hope to implement empire management and nobility.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/songs_of_syx/store12.png">	47.49	2020-09-20	BR0	129	2021-04-15 00:20:32.767+00	\N	\N	2021-04-15 00:20:35.822+00	2021-04-15 00:20:36.12+00

A destiny as yet unwritten.\n<br><br><b>The Tale</b><br>\nA few years have passed since our heroes heroically defeated the arch-witch Mortroga. And their lives, like the lives of most people in Aventásia, are still in turmoil. The War of the Two Towers is over, but the wounds it left upon the land are still bleeding. \n<br>\nThe gnome Wilbur Weathervane is struggling with his new job as a teacher at the reopened School for Wizardry and Witchcraft. His magic wand is having a mind of its own and an assassination plot against the arch-mage overshadows the first democratic elections in Seastone.\n<br>\nFaced with political intrigues that threaten the delicate balance of peace, Wilbur is in dire need of his old friends. But the elf princess Ivo and the adventurer Nate have, after a brief romantic interlude, gone their separate ways.\n<br>\nIvo has returned to her gilded cage in the elf kingdom, overprotected by her controlling mother.Nate along with his trusty companion Critter has been taken prisoner on the flying island of his arch-enemy the Red Pirate.\n<br>\nBut fate does not rest. A darkness has fallen upon the land, or rather, a pinkness. A magic force is turning mighty beasts into fluffy plush puppies and towering castles into oversized dollhouses. Every world needs its heroes. However unlikely they may seem.\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">A new adventure from KING Art, the creators of The Book of Unwritten Tales, The Critter Chronicles and The Raven – Legacy of a Master Thief</li><li class="description__features-point">A fantasy story with over&nbsp;20 hours of pointing and clicking</li><li class="description__features-point">The trademark BoUT-humor, lovingly spoofing LotR, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Discworld, The Hobbit, WoW and more!</li><li class="description__features-point">Hundreds of weird, yet oddly logical puzzles</li><li class="description__features-point">The well-proven&nbsp;"Multi-Character-Gameplay"</li><li class="description__features-point">The established&nbsp;four playable characters&nbsp;Wilbur, Nate, Ivo and Critter</li><li class="description__features-point">An ensemble of&nbsp;quirky characters, both well-established and brand-new</li><li class="description__features-point">Projection Mapping technology unites the merits of 2D and 3D styles and technique</li><li class="description__features-point">An&nbsp;epic soundtrack&nbsp;with all the classics and many new compositions</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2015 KING Art GmbH &amp; Nordic Games GmbH.

Max is a hyperkinetic rabbity-thing with a taste for mayhem. Together, they're the Freelance Police. And they're about to save the world.<br><br><b>Good to have you back, little buddy!</b><br>\nIn 2006, the comic book crime-fighting duo Sam &amp; Max starred in the first full-fledged episodic game from Telltale, the studio that went on to make The Walking Dead and Batman: The Enemy Within .<br><br>\nNow everyone's favorite dog and rabbity-thing are back in <b>Sam &amp; Max Save the World Remastered</b>, a new version of their first season of episodic games that has been lovingly updated by a small group of the original developers with the blessing of Sam &amp; Max creator Steve Purcell.<br><br>\nReturn to the adventure game that was once called "gaming's first sitcom" and is today known as "the remaster you didn't know you were waiting for." With enhanced graphics, new widescreen and gamepad support, five new musical tracks, and the same brain-tickling puzzles and offbeat humor that won it IGN's Best Adventure GOTY award back in the day, <b>Sam &amp; Max Save the World Remastered</b> is a modern classic that you'll love to play—or play again.<br><br><b>Now, let's go save the world... </b><br>\nIt's just another day at the office for the self-proclaimed Freelance Police when the Commissioner calls in with a disturbing report: former child stars are running amok in the street! What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the "spinny thing" they do with their eyes.)<br><br>\nWho's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam &amp; Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds.<br><p class="description__copyrights">\n            ©2006-2020 Skunkape Games LLC and Steve Purcell.

Fortunately, your offense is equally unique, as the high-powered mining tools at your disposal provide the means to fight against the threat.\n<br><br><b>Messy monster slaying.</b><br>\nThe Necromorphs are unlike any enemies you've seen before.

Send horizontal or vertical blasts of energy at enemies with the Plasma Cutter, remotely control a high-speed sawblade with the Disc Ripper, and fill hallways with wide swaths of destruction with the Line Gun. Switch things up with alternate fire modes, and purchase upgrades to increase ammo, power, and reload speed.\n<br><br><b>Real-time attacks.</b><br>\nWhatever you do, don’t drop your guard. Everything takes place in real-time. That means any action you take, whether it be reloading or digging through your inventory, gives the Necromorphs a perfect opportunity to attack.

From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view.\n<br><br>\nA big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships. You can leave a ship, climb down a ladder, walk over the dock of a large space station into another ship you may have parked there and replace the pilot that was working for you just by clicking on his chair.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/01_gif_fight.gif"><br><br><b>Modular stations and ship upgrades:</b><br><br>\nBuilding space stations and factories has always been a foundation of the X games. After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to establish their own economy and start influencing the universe on a larger scale. In X4, it is now possible to be completely free and creative. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The powerful new map system allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations.\n<br><br>\nShips also offer a variety of upgrades. Engines, weapons and other equipment can be added in a graphical editor and actually seen on the ship.\n<br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/02_gif_docking.gif"><br><br><b>Most dynamic X universe ever:</b><br><br>\nX4 will be the first X game to allow our races and factions to freely build and expand their empires; the same flexibility the player enjoys in creatively designing space stations from modular building blocks is also available to them. Races expand their empire based on supply and demand, which leads to an extremely dynamic universe where every action the player makes can influence the course of the entire universe.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/x4_foundations/02_x4_store_banner_02.png"><br><b>Managing your empire with a powerful map:</b><br><br>\nOnce you have more ships and many NPCs working for you as pilots, crew or station managers, the map will be your preferred method of managing it all. Ships can be ordered with simple clicks and through drag-and-drop operations to set their future path and commands.\n<br><br>\nGraphically plan your trade routes, coordinate attacks with your entire fleet, manage the hierarchy or send ships on remote exploration missions.\n<br><br><br><b>Most detailed X economy ever:</b><br><br>\nOne of the key selling points of X games has always been the realistic, simulated economy. Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game, all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it. Everything comes out of the simulated economy.\n<br><br><br><b>Research and Teleportation:</b><br><br>\nThe seamless change from ship to ship and from NPCs controlling your empire for you continues on a higher level. Once you own a larger fleet, you will be very interested in researching a technology from your HQ: Teleportation. Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand.\n<br><br>\nEvery order you have given to a ship before turns into a mission objective when you pilot the ship yourself. The moment you leave again, your pilot takes the helm and continues with their previous orders.\n<br><br><br><b>Get into the game:</b><br><br>\nIn X4, you can start your journey from a number of different gamestarts and as a number of different characters, each with their own role, set of relationships and different ships and technologies to start with. No matter how you start, you are always free to develop in any other direction. Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to you to decide.\n\n\n            \n    	97.99	2018-11-29	BR0	116	2021-04-15 00:27:59.052+00	\N	\N	2021-04-15 00:28:09.287+00	2021-04-15 00:28:09.383+00

Create a megalopolis by weaving together a tapestry of cities ranging from a bedroom community to a high tech urban center or a vacation destination to a farming village. You can create a region of interconnected cities sharing and competing for resources that are linked by a fully integrated transportation network. Use "god-like" powers to create mountain ranges, carve valleys, and lay rivers to construct the most realistic metropolis imaginable. The new simulation engine offers immediate feedback so you can react to the needs of an expanding metropolis. Now individual buildings and their lots provide you with feedback. Use the My Sim features to personalize your Sim and immediately move him or her into any area and watch them experience life around town and get instant feedback on the city's progress. Each decision has a greater impact and gives you the ability to respond more effectively.\n<br><br>\nHave the ultimate level of control over your city's transportation network by completely taking charge of roads, rail, air, waterways, and even vehicles. U-Drive It! missions will be presented for you to solve, such as chasing down a bank robber or apprehending a car-jacker. If missions are completed successfully, you will earn reward buildings and other vehicles. As traction is gained by fixing problems and accomplishing missions, your mayor approval rating will soar and Sims will flock to your city. Choose from all-new road types including wide-avenues, suspension bridges, or one-way streets, as well as map out seamless regional networks that whisk Sims from one city to another. Additional options include going global to create a metropolis based on an all-new modern European building set or personalizing new creations by labeling streets, mountains, neighborhoods, and points of interest. Wreak havoc with all-new disasters including a UFO invasion, massive wrecks at railroad crossings, and the occasional car fender bender. There are also all-new tutorials available to help you get started. New gameplay levels are also available so you can create the city of your dreams. \n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Create a megalopolis by weaving together a tapestry of cities ranging from a bedroom community to a high tech urban center or a vacation destination to a farming village.</li><li class="description__features-point">Use "god-like" powers to create mountain ranges, carve valleys, and lay rivers to construct the most realistic metropolis imaginable.</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            SimCity™ 4 Deluxe Edition © 2003 Electronic Arts Inc.\n        </p>	110.99	2003-09-21	BR0	57	2021-04-15 00:30:30.632+00	\N	\N	2021-04-15 00:30:34.049+00	2021-04-15 00:30:38.87+00

Kain has created an empire in the world of Nosgoth where almost all humans have been exterminated. To help him maintain control over such large territory he chooses five lieutenants to command his vampire forces. Your name is Raziel and you are one of those lieutenants. Ages have passed by and during that time you have been has “blessed” with something no other vampire has--wings. Kain, being evil and jealous vampire, punished Raziel for his "transgression". Jealous Kain tore off Raziel’s wings and cast him down into the Lake of the Dead. A millenium has passed while Raziel lay forgotten before he is brought back to existence by The Elder God. He becomes a soul reaver with one purpose and one purpose only--kill Kain.\n<br><br>\nLegacy of Kain: Soul Reaver continues the story from Blood Omen in a very clever and interesting way while also adding many new gameplay features. One of those improvements is the ability to shift between spectral and material plane. Both worlds overlap each other in a way that allows Raziel to overcome obstacles in one world by simply shifting to the other. But beware, because both of those planes are anything but a safe place and something that is harmless on one side can kill you on the other. Soul Reaver is a chapter in a series of masterpieces. With a gripping story, fluent gameplay, and a number so unique features it is clearly one of the most prominent tiles in the gaming history and it is surely worth checking out.\n<br><br><img src="http://items.gog.com/SoulReaver_ratings.png"><ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Gothic atmosphere set by stylized visuals and moody music that dynamically changes with the environment.</li><li class="description__features-point">Ability to shift between two overlapping realms (spectral and material) creates unique puzzle-solving possibilities.</li><li class="description__features-point">Fascinating, wide-reaching story about betrayal and vengeance presented in so convincing and believable way that it really makes you thirst for souls of your adversaries.</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            © Square Enix Limited, 1999\n        </p>	12.99	1999-09-07	BR16	156	2021-04-15 00:27:54.104+00	\N	\N	2021-04-15 00:28:08.711+00	2021-04-15 00:28:08.803+00

Known as the "City of Doors," Sigil is a neutral ground where demons, devas, and races from across the multiverse gather under the watchful shadow of the Lady of Pain, the city's enigmatic ruler. This is a place where the word is mightier than the sword, where thought defines reality, and belief has the power to reshape worlds.\n<br><br>\nIn your search for answers, you'll find companions matching the bizarre nature of the planes: a chaste succubus who can kill with a kiss, a confused crossbow-wielding cube, a suit of armor animated by a spirit demanding JUSTICE, and more. With these companions and others at The Nameless One’s side, you will explore worlds in search of answers, all to discover that some destinies cannot be escaped and some memories cost more than an even an immortal can bear.\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point"><b>Enhanced Planescape:</b> Chris Avellone, Lead Designer on Planescape Torment, has partnered with Beamdog to curate gameplay updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to best capture his original vision for the game.</li><li class="description__features-point"><b>The Planes Await:</b> Planescape is a setting you've never experienced before, filled with strange magics, bizarre adversaries, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons locations from across the multiverse.</li><li class="description__features-point"><b>Conversations to Remember:</b> Encounter personable items, philosophic undead, and rat hiveminds while walking the planes with the strangest collection of allies ever seen in an RPG.</li><li class="description__features-point"><b>Pick Your Path:</b> Character creation is just the beginning.

Trained from early childhood and mutated to gain superhuman skills, strength and reflexes, witchers are a distrusted counterbalance to the monster-infested world in which they live. You are a drifter, always on the move, following in the footsteps of tragedy to make other people's problems your own - if the pay is good. You are now taking on your most important contract yet: to track down the child of prophecy, a living weapon, a key to save or destroy this world. You will make choices that go beyond good &amp; evil, and you will face their far reaching consequences.\n<br><br>\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a story-driven next-generation open world role-playing game, set in a troubled and morally indifferent fantasy universe. Built for endless adventure, the massive open world of The Witcher sets new standards in terms of size, depth and complexity. You will traverse a vast open world, rich with merchant cities, dangerous mountain passes, and forgotten caverns to explore. It's survival of the fittest - deal with treasonous generals, devious witches and corrupt royalty to provide dark and dangerous services, then invest your rewards to upgrade your equipment, or spend them away on pleasures of the night.\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt © 2014 CD Projekt S.A.

Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four-armed half-human / half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans' favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice-wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.\n<br><br>\nRe-live this arcade classic with the first 3 instalments of the Mortal Kombat franchise.

Design, maintain and manage a hi-tech hospital facility, making the most of limited resources and turning cures into cash. The Grim Reaper stalks the corridors, the ill have some very odd ailments, and the staff want to play doctors and nurses together. No matter how you look at it, you're in control of a very sick hospital.\n<br><br>\nIf there is one word that describes Theme Hospital then it has to be “hilarious.” Almost everything in this game is made with great dose of humour. You might think that someone's illness is not a laughing matter but wait till you see a patient with KingComplex dressed as Elvis or serious case of Hairyitis caused from prolonged exposure to the moon. Finding treatments for such diseases is a part of your job, but there’s no prescription to cure the insanity that may result from trying to figure out those cures. You start off small with an empty building, a few doctors, a general diagnostic, a pharmacy, a reception desk, and a few other necessities. From there it’s up to you to move your way up in the health care industry.\n<br><br>\nA hospital simulator is not something you might consider a good theme for a game but the guys from Bullfrog Productions were famous for creating innovative and fun titles from the craziest idea--and Theme Hospital no exception. This game is a piece of art and definitely the best “hospital” simulation so check it out.

TriOptimum Corporation	<i>TriOptimum wishes you a safe journey aboard the Von Braun, the first craft in the history of mankind capable of faster-than-light travel. TriOptimum Corporation: we give you the stars!</i><br><br>\nThe second--and best!--game in the series stands all on its own as a masterpiece of gaming history. The starship Von Braun took a giant leap for mankind as it made its first interstellar journey. The mission was going as planned until a lone distress call from the Tau Ceti V sector was picked up. An away team was sent on a rescue mission, but once it arrived at its destination, there was no sign of any humans and the source of the signal remained unclear. They didn't realize something crucial, though: they brought something back with them when they returned. Now, you--a member of the ship's security team--awake from cryostasis to the sounds of screams of pain and horror as everything falls apart. The state-of-the-art spaceship becomes a deathtrap, and the only hope you have is the contemptuous whisper of a voice guiding you through the dark corridors, leading you towards the ominous secrets that lurk in the shadows.\n<br><br>\nA game like this is a masterpiece; you must experience it firsthand. System Shock™ 2 arguably offers the most intense storytelling in the history of computer games. It perfectly splices Sci-Fi with survival horror, FPS gameplay with character stats, upgrades, and inventory system of the role-playing genre, fast paced action with chilling terror. As you slowly and carefully explore your surroundings, the game begins to swallow you whole, and soon enough you feel completely immersed in the terrifying reality of an interstellar ghost-ship. Then, even years after your first contact with the game, just hearing the words "System Shock™ 2" will make your heart race. This is going to be a hell of a journey, for a pathetic creature of meat and bone such as yourself.\n<br><br>\nCheck out our <b><a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general_archive/mod_spotlight_system_shock_2">Mod Spotlight for System Shock 2!</a></b><br><br>\n-<i>"10 out of 10"</i> - Computer Games Magazine<br>\n-<i>"An advanced, progressive spin on first-person gaming"</i> - Edge Online<br>\n-<i>"One of the 100 best games of all time"</i> - Empire Online<br>\n-<i>"95%"</i> - PC Gamer<br>\n-<i>"Greatest Games of all Times"</i> list - Gamespot<br>\n-<i>"Top 50 Greatest Games of All Time"</i> list - Gamespy<br><br><ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">The most requested game on the <a href="http://www.gog.com/wishlist/games/system_shock_2" class="vdark_un">GOG.com wishlist</a> has arrived at last!</li><li class="description__features-point">Three character profiles to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses: the psionic power-wielding agent, the naval officer--a masterful hacker, and the marine, a combat specialist.</li><li class="description__features-point">You don't have to face the horror alone.

Building on the successful elements that drew players to DOOM, Quake brings a more Gothic flavour to the FPS genre and, like its predecessor, has spawned copycats and sequels over the years. The game is also renowned for creating and popularising Machinima, as the game engine was used to create Machinima classic’s such as “The Diary of a Camper” and “The Seal of Nehahra”. This GOG release also contains the two expansions for this first installment, “Quake Mission Pack No. 1: Scourge of Armagon” and “Quake Mission Pack No. 2: Dissolution of Eternity”, bringing even more interdimensional horrors and weapons to your PC. With the main game soundtrack composed by Trent Reznor, you’re in for one heart-stopping hell of a ride. \n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">4 difficulties to choose from </li><li class="description__features-point">Battle and explore your way through over 60 levels</li><li class="description__features-point">Ghoulish Gothic atmosphere enhanced by a captivating soundtrack</li></ul>	55.51	1998-10-04	BR0	6	2021-04-15 00:30:38.016+00	\N	\N	2021-04-15 00:30:39.251+00	2021-04-15 00:30:39.503+00

To become a deity, you must conquer all 25 planets of the system and defeat every other tribe and their shamans. The ultimate struggle will be a difficult one, as you build mystical cities, unleash devastating spells, harness volcanoes and tornadoes, and shape the face of the planet at your will. Remember, your apotheosis awaits!\n<br><br>\nIn the third part of the Populous series, you control your shaman and the tribe of her followers in a difficult quest to conquer all 25 planets of a star system and ascend to godhood. For the first time in the series, the world is presented in true 3d, which at the time amazed both the players and the gaming press.The level of control you exert over your followers also takes you to a new level: you can order individuals or groups to perform certain tasks like gathering resources, constructing buildings, or attacking your enemies.\n<br><br>\nPopulous: The Beginning takes a slightly different approach from the previous installments of the series but this is not, by any means, a bad thing as it kept the series fresh and innovative. It was a bold move for Bullfrog but the proof exists in the fact that, after all these years Populous 3 is still a great strategy god-game.<br><br><ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point"><b>Includes Populous the Beginning and the Undiscovered Worlds expansion.</b></li><li class="description__features-point">Engage in a quest to become a god!

The development team at LucasArts is bringing the game into the modern era with an all new re-imagined contemporary art style, a re-mastered musical score, full voiceover, and an in-depth hint system to help players through the game’s side-splitting puzzles. Purists will also delight in the ability to seamlessly switch between the updated hand-drawn re-imagining and the original classic version.\n<br><br>\nThe game's twisty plot leads our naive hero on a hilarious, swash-buckling search for the fabled secret of Monkey Island. Tales of pirate wealth lure him to the port of Mêlée with high hopes, no money, and insatiable curiosity. If clever enough, he will win the confidence of Mêlée's pirates and find himself blown by the winds of fate toward the terrifying and legendary Monkey Island -- an adventure that would chill the bones of even the most bloodthirsty buccaneer.\n\n                    <ul class="description__features"><li class="description__features-point">Go on a daring adventure in your attempt to become the most infamous pirate in the Caribbean!</li><li class="description__features-point">Scene-for-scene hot swap allows for seamless transition between special edition and classic modes anywhere and at any time.</li><li class="description__features-point">Complete voice over using the original Monkey Island™ franchise cast brings the story and characters of the original adventures to life like never before.</li></ul><p class="description__copyrights">\n            LucasArts and the LucasArts logo are trademarks of Lucasfilm Ltd. in the United States and/or other countries. © 1990-2014 Lucasfilm Ltd.
